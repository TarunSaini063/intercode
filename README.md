InterCode is an application that takes Telephonic Technical Interviews to  next level, by allowing Interviewer and Interviewee to work on
the same  Code Editor window simultaneously and be able to compile and run the  code to check the correctness.
Feature:
1. Both must be able to communicate with each other by sending and  receiving messages (in a separate conversation tab).
2. The interviewer can enter details about the candidate in the database.
3. They both must be able to work on the same editor window  simultaneously (typing in one directly changes the other’s code).
4. Both should be able to compile and run C, C++, Java, Python codes.
5. The application must precisely display compile and runtime errors  and output for a given set of inputs.
6. Implement options like Find and Replace (provide an option for regex) 
7. Keyword highlight according to the language selected. 
8. Change font size and style in editor.
9. Show line number in the editor. 
10. The interviewer must be able to give a question to the Interviewee  for him to solve.  
11.Auto-complete should be possible which suggests a list of possible  words when ctrl+space is entered.
